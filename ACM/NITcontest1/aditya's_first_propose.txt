I have one year experience in android application development.
I developed an app "World News" uses RSS feed and HTML Parsing to retrieve data from the Google News Database.
Another android app "Top Tracks" uses XML Parsing and JSON concepts and displays recent top music tracks depending on the user's location.
Recenty i developed "Textify The Call" app as team project.It converts the voice conversation over a call into text in REAL time.


now, i want to make anroid OS by myself.. currently making a android tiny kernel as a project for ECXALLIBUR
